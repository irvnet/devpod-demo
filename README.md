# devpod-demo

## Introduction

So I'm poking around looking for some options for creating container based dev environments. I've tried Gitpod (which I actually like) but I was looking for something simpler that I could run on the infra of my choice. Over time as I've talked to customers, particularly those working on full stack projects or devops projects across different types of environments I've seen them struggle with finding something sustainable for handingling dependencies in a relatively simple, reliable reproduceable way.  Even though I like that Gitpod streamlines the experience I periodically look around for something self-hosted, simple and customizable. Recently, I ran across **DevPod** from Loft Labs, that caught my interest.
